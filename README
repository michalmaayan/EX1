EX: 1

FILES:
1. README -- this README file
2. osm.cpp -- our code for the second part of the exercise


REMARKS:
Task 1:
After we ran the program using strace, we were expected to insert a single
argument. The program creates two directories in our file system, the first one
named "Welcome", and the second one (inside "Welcome" directory) named "To".
Inside the "To" directory the program creates a new file called "OS2018" and
writes the following string inside: "michal.maayan\nIf you haven't read the
course guidelines yet --- do it right now!\nhello" ("hello" was the argument
we have inserted to the program at the beginning).
Now this file is going to be deleted (using "unlink" command), and the two
directories are also going to be deleted (using "rmdir" command).

Task 2:
The runtime results comparisons are in the "Capture.PNG" file.
